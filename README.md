VisionAI: AI-Powered EDA & Visualization AgentVisionAI is a full-stack web application that leverages a sophisticated AI agent to automate the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process. Users can sign up, log in, and upload their CSV datasets to receive a complete suite of auto-generated visualizations, each accompanied by insightful, AI-powered captions.🌟 FeaturesUser Authentication: Secure signup, login, and logout functionality.CSV File Upload: An intuitive dashboard for users to upload their datasets.Automated EDA: A powerful backend agent profiles the data to identify numerical and categorical columns.Dynamic Plot Generation: Automatically creates a variety of plots based on the data's characteristics:Histograms and Box Plots for numerical data distributions.Bar Charts for categorical data frequencies.Correlation Heatmaps for relationships between numerical features.AI-Generated Captions: Each visualization is paired with a concise, insightful summary generated by an LLM (powered by Groq).Beautiful & Soothing UI: A modern, responsive frontend built with Tailwind CSS, featuring a calming aesthetic and smooth animations.🛠️ Tech StackBackend: FlaskAI Agent Framework: LangGraph, LangChainLLM for Generation: GroqEmbeddings & RAG: Ollama with nomic-embed-textVector Store: ChromaDBData Manipulation: PandasVisualization: Matplotlib & SeabornFrontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript📂 Project Structure.

⚙️ Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.1. Clone the Repositorygit clone [https://github.com/your-username/visionai.git](https://github.com/your-username/visionai.git)
cd visionai
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment# For Windows
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
3. Install DependenciesInstall all the required Python packages.pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file by running pip freeze > requirements.txt in your project's activated virtual environment.)4. Set Up OllamaThis project relies on Ollama for generating embeddings.Install Ollama: Follow the instructions on the official Ollama website.Pull the Embedding Model: Open your terminal and run the following command to download the required model:ollama pull nomic-embed-text
Run the Ollama Server: In a new, separate terminal window, start the Ollama server. Keep this terminal running in the background.ollama serve
5. Build the RAG Knowledge BaseThe agent uses a ChromaDB vector store. Run the RAG pipeline script once to build it.python src/pipeline/rag_pipeline.py
This will create a chroma_db folder in your project root.6. Set Up Environment VariablesYou need a Groq API key for the LLM. Create a .env file in the project root and add your key:GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
The application will load this key automatically.7. Run the Flask ApplicationNow you're ready to start the web server.python app.py
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser.🚀 UsageSign Up: Create a new account from the landing page.Login: Log in with your newly created credentials.Upload: On the dashboard, click the "Upload a file" area to select a .csv file from your computer.Analyze: Click the "Analyze Dataset" button. A loading animation will appear while the agent processes the data.View Results: The page will automatically refresh to display the generated plots and their corresponding AI-powered insights.Logout: Click the logout button in the navigation bar to end your session and return to the landing page.📄 LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
